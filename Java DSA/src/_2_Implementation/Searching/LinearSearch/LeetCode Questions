Q1. Find Numbers with Even Numbers of Digits
SOL:
        Naive Approach: O(N^2)
        Count the digits by first doing a linear search in array and then taking out digit from the end
        using the divide by 10 method.
        Check whether the number of digits is even or odd, if even increase count.
        Return the count

        Kunal Approach:
        Use the (Math.log10() + 1) method on each of the digits, typecast the return value to integer and check
        whether the integer is even or odd, if even increase count.
        Return the count.

Q2. Richest Customer Wealth
SOL:
        Naive Approach: O(N^2)
        Go through all elements of 2D Array and add wealth of all bank accounts in a single array.
        Assign that wealth to a variable.
        Repeat the process for all customer arrays and compare the wealth to wealth variable each
        time a customer array is fully traversed.
        Return the wealth variable.
