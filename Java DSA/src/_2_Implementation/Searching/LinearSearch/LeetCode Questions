Q1. Find Numbers with Even Numbers of Digits
SOL:
        Naive Approach: O(N^2)
        Count the digits by first doing a linear search in array and then taking out digit from the end
        using the divide by 10 method.
        Check whether the number of digits is even or odd, if even increase count.
        Return the count

        Kunal Approach: O(N*logN)
        Use the (Math.log10() + 1) method on each of the numbers, typecast the return value to integer and check
        whether the integer is even or odd, if even increase count.
        Return the count.

Q2. Richest Customer Wealth
SOL:
        Naive Approach: O(N^2)
        Go through all elements of 2D Array and add wealth of all bank accounts present in a single array (row).
        Assign that wealth sum to a variable.
        Repeat the process for all customer arrays (rows) and compare the wealth sum to current value of wealth
        variable each time a customer array is fully traversed.
        If the value in wealth variable is less than current customer array sum, change value of wealth variable
        to current customer array sum. (maximum logic)
        Return the wealth variable.
