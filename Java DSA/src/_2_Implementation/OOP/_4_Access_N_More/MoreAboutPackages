// Two types of Packages:
    /*
        1) User-Defined Packages ... Everything we were doing so far consisted of this
        2) In-built Packages ... predefined packages in Java
           - lang -> basic language specific classes which are essential (e.g. Implementation of primitive data types)
           - io -> classes related to Input Output, especially File Reading
           - util -> utility classes, consists of data structures
           - applet -> (towards development side, now OBSOLETE) used for creating servlets
           - awt -> (this too is obsolete) used for GUI
           - net -> for networking operations

        Most Used: lang, util, io(mostly for files)
        Other important stuff:
        'Collections' framework (will be covered later)
        'Object' class -> Root of the class hierarchy
