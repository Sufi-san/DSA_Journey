Note: Patterns solved in this folder can be solved in assignments folder again too. (practice)

Importance of Pattern Questions:
     Enhances Thought Process
     Very Important for building foundation

How we can solve Patterns?
    Things may look different but there are similarities
    Few steps are needed to be kept in mind while starting to solve

Pre-requisites:
    Conditionals
    Loops

Approach:
    Imagine 2D Arrays
    Run outer for-loop based on the number of horizontal lines required (rows)
    Inner for-loops based on the number of vertical lines required (columns)

Steps:
    Identify for every row -
       1. How many columns are there
       2. Types of elements in col
    What do you need to print?
    Try to find the formula relating rows and columns

    Whenever, the pattern is of number printing, try not to use zero index
    by doing this, we can directly make use of numbers easily when required.

    For complex patterns, they can be divided into parts.
    Mostly very complex patterns can be divide into four different parts and
    then we adjust interval values and print values according to the conditions
    in each part.

    In some cases there are simple solutions to the problems but those solutions
    are very counter-intuitive. For such problems it is necessary to see, understand
    and remember the solution for future use.
    PRACTICE is Key.
