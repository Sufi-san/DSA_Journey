            The size of an int in Java is completely independent of the 32-bitness or 64-bitness of a JDK.
            It is always 4 bytes = 32 bits = âˆ’2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. If you want a 64-bit integer,
            use a long , which is always 64 bits = 8 bytes.
            When any int occupies less than 32-bits, the left bits remaining are automatically assumed 0
            However, when we take complement, these assumed 0s also turn to 1 !!!
            This however, does not affect the usual behavior of bitwise operators.

            What happened in num & ~bitMask ??
            Answer:
                    num = 10110110 (in binary), (bits remaining from 32 to the left assumed 0)
                    bitMask = 1 << 5 - 1 = 16 = 10000 (in Binary), (bits remaining from 32 to the left assumed 0)
                    Thus, (IN 32-bit BINARY FORMAT)
                      bitMask = 00000000000000000000000000010000 , bitCount(bitMask) = 1
                          num = 00000000000000000000000010110110 , bitCount(num) = 5
                     ~bitMask = 11111111111111111111111111101111 , bitCount(~bitMask) = 31
               num & ~bitMask = 00000000000000000000000010100110 , bitCount(num & ~bitMask) = 4
         */
        System.out.println(SetBit.convertToBase2(num ^ bitMask)); // num ^ bitMask will also work
        return SetBit.convertToBase2(num & ~bitMask); // since we get answer in base10 form, convertToBase2 for binary
