1. This folder consists of solution for assignment questions from Kunal's DSA Bootcamp.

2. Files ending with 'D' are DONE, 'U' are Unlocked, 'L' are Locked which represents their state of completion.

3. For leetcode problems, a text file is created inside each folder and the segregated (easy/medium/hard) links to those problems are added to that text file.

4. If that particular question is already solved, a "(DONE)" is added to the end of the link.

5. For special problems another java program file will be created to save the solution code for that particular problem.

6. If by any chance I start blogging about solutions to some special problems, the links to those will be added in a text file in respective folders with the serial number of the problem in the problem link text file.
