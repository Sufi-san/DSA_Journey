The example from the Die-hard movie was used to understand the concept
        If we have a 3L and 5L gallon, how do we precisely measure 4L?
        After understanding the process, we now know of the equation:
            r = ax - by = ax + (-by)
            where, 'r' is the amount of water left
                   'a' and 'b' are the capacity of both gallons respectively
                   'x' is amount of times gallon 'a' was filled
                   'y' is amount of times gallon 'b' was emptied
            Thus, we got it in the form of a linear equation.

        Now, the other concept was that, if for the equation,
        Minimum POSITIVE value of (ax - by) = 1, then '1' is the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of 'a' and 'b'
        HCF is also called GCD(Greatest Common Divisor)

        Eg: Factors of 4 -> 1, 2, 4
            Factors of 18 -> 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
            Highest Common Factor -> 2
            If we see '4x + 18y', for 'x = -4' and 'y = 1' we get 4(-4) + 18(1) = 18 - 16 = 2 = Min +ve Value = HCF
        Note: Whatever comes out as common from the equation is the HCF!!, like 1(4x + 18y), 2x + 4y = 2(x + 2y)

       From this, we understand that if we know the 'a' and 'b' and are required to solve for another value,
       we can find out whether the solution is possible by the following process:
       Eg:
            2x + 4y = 5, Possible ?
            2x + 4y = 2(x + 2y) = 5,
            Now, x + 2y = 2.5
            As we cannot use the gallons to form a decimal value,
            It is not possible to measure 5L using gallons 2L and 4L

            3x + 6y = 9, Possible ?
            3(x + 2y) = 9, Thus, x + 2y = 9/3 = 3, Therefore it is possible!

            13x + 24y = 6, Possible ?
            1(13x + 24y) = 6, Thus, 13x + 24y = 6/1 = 6, Therefor it is possible!
