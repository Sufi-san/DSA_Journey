First thing to do after creating a folder for an algorithm or data structure, is to bring notes from Kunal's DSA Bootcamp and paste them in that respective folder.

Secondly, if you find any other resources with great/additional information online create a text file and add all their links in that file.

Third, if you find any offline resources like handwritten notes/hard-copies, take a picture and then add to respective folder.
