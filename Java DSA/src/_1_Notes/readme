First thing to do after creating a folder for any topic, is to bring notes from Kunal's DSA Bootcamp repo and paste them in that respective folder.

Secondly, if you find any other resources with great/additional information online create a text file and add all their links in that file.

Third, if you find any offline resources like handwritten notes/hard-copies, take a picture or make a pdf and then add to respective folder.
